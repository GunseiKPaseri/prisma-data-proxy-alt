## Performance Measurement

### Prerequisite

The database is Planetscale and is located in the same region as each PDP instance.

1. Official PDP provided by cloud.prisma.io (Northern Virginia) + Planetscale (Northern Virginia)
2. Alternative PDP deployed on Cloud Run (Tokyo) + Planetscale (Tokyo)
3. Alternative PDP deployed on Cloud Run (Northern Virginia) + Planetscale (Northern Virginia)

Measurements are performed by connecting from Nagoya, Japan.

100 records (ids) are retrieved from the table and measured.

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const db = new PrismaClient();
const hrstart = process.hrtime();
await db.link.findMany({ select: { id: true }, take: 100 });
const hrend = process.hrtime(hrstart);
console.info('Execution time (hr): %ds %dms', hrend[0], hrend[1] / 1000_000);
```

### Result

We can see that the latency of the official PDP is quite large.
What is surprising is that not only the self-hosted PDP installed in the Tokyo region is faster, but also the PDP installed in Northern Virginia, the same region as the official one, has a much smaller latency.
